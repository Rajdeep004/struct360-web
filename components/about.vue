                Any delay in your construction project due to a structural design error can impact your timelines and budget. Grubb Engineering provides services that build value in each step from the beginning. Our services range from conceptual design to full BIM component shop drawings, so there isnâ€™t a need to coordinate with multiple companies. We can also help cut down timelines and errors with our high-quality 3D modelling of your entire building. So, if something does not align during the construction process, we can zoom right into the area that your contractors are presently working on to identify and solve issues - in real time. Our team of knowledgeable structural engineers is here to ensure your construction project is safe, completed on time and has value added.
